Catan Enterprises completed their first ground-up construction project: 2500 Hauser Boulevard in October 2012, 16 busy months after the groundbreaking. The house is nearly 1300 sq. ft of finished living area including 3 bedrooms and one bathroom.

The house is sided with local _blue stained pine_, or beetle-kill pine from property adjacent the Lewis & Clark National Forest. These trees were thinned in fire-prevention measures and milled by us during Summer and Fall 2012.

This is our only property currently to embrace a Larson-Truss framing design. This means that the walls are one foot thick, composed of two layers of traditional 2x4 framing with a 4-inch gap separating the two walls.  Once sealed with a vapor barrier, these walls were filled with loose-fill cellulose. This super-insulated home kept us cool in the summer during construciton months and we have heard from our tenants that a small fire in the central woodstove will keep the home very comfortable in the winter. The home also features electric baseboard heat to supplement the woodstove.
